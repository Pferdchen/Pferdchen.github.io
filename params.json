A programmer has to learn the new skills or technologies continuously to adjust himself for various of requirements in his career. One way to gain the experiences is from working and another way is in practice at school or home.\r\n\r\nEach software company provides the same programming environment for its developers such as programming language, framework, IDE, database, issue (or project) tracking system and version control system. These skills are almost inflexible. Many projects use Subversion as version control system and Jira (or Bugzilla) as issue (or project) tracking system. My company is no exception.\r\n\r\nI had built a private programming environment home. I had installed [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) and [WebSVN](http://www.websvn.info) on Debian and later changed to install [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) on CentOS, since Git is becoming increasingly popular. I had to be not only as a programmer but also as an administrator. Switching between both roles made me tired and I could not focus on programming.\r\n\r\nThanks to GitHub. It realizes not only all features of Git, but also bug tracking on its web. It saves my life. I can focus on writing my projects anywhere and all the of them will be managed by GitHub.\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\nSome of projects are running or waiting to start.\r\n\r\n## [Sudoku](https://github.com/Pferdchen/sudoku) (running)\r\nDesign and implement a sudoku algorithm with Java Swing and AWT.
