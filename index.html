<p>The programming world is being changed everyday. A programmer has to learn the new skills or technology continuously to adjust himself for various of requirements in his career. One way to gain the experiences is from working and another way is in practice at school or home.</p>

<p>Each software company provides the same programming environment for its developers - programming language, framework, IDE, database, issue (or project) tracking system and version control system. The skills are almost inflexible. Many projects use Subversion as version control system and Jira (or Bugzilla) as issue (or project) tracking system. My company is no exception.</p>

<p>I had built a private programming environment home. I had installed <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> and <a href="http://www.websvn.info">WebSVN</a> on Debian and later changed to install <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> on CentOS, because Git is becoming increasingly popular. I had to be not only as a programmer but also as an administrator. Switching between both roles made me tired and could not focus on programming.</p>

<p>Thanks to GitHub. It realizes not only all features of Git, but also bug tracking on its web. It saves my life. I can focus on writing my projects anywhere and all the of them will be managed by GitHub.</p>
